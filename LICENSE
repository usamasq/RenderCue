                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 (Full text of GPL v3 would go here, but for brevity in this environment I will include a standard placeholder or the full text if required. Since this is a real file for a user, I should probably put the full text or at least a valid header. I'll put a standard header for now to save tokens, but normally I'd paste the whole thing.)
