# RenderCue Persistence Feature Summary

## What Changed?

### Before (v1.0):

- Settings stored in `WindowManager` (session-only)
- Queue was lost when closing Blender
- Had to rebuild queue every time

### After (v1.1):

- Settings stored in `Scene` (persistent with .blend file)
- Queue **saves with your .blend file**
- Opens exactly as you left it

## How It Works Now:

### 1. **Persistent Storage** ✓

```python
bpy.types.Scene.rendercue = bpy.props.PointerProperty(type=RenderCueSettings)
```

**Benefits**:

- Queue is part of your .blend file
- Survives Blender.restart
- Can have different queues per scene
- Perfect for project workflows

### 2. **VSE Integration**

The RenderCue settings are now in `context.scene.rendercue`, so:

- When you sync to VSE, the settings persist
- You can close/reopen Blend file and queue is intact
- Future: Can add bidirectional sync (VSE → RenderCue)

## Usage:

1. **Setup Queue**:

   - Add scenes to RenderCue
   - Configure overrides
   - Set output paths

2. **Sync to VSE**:

   - Click "Sync to VSE"
   - See your sequence in the editor
   - Settings are preserved in the scene

3. **Save & Resume**:

   - Save your .blend file
   - Close Blender
   - Reopen → Queue is still there!

4. **Continue Rendering**:
   - No need to rebuild queue
   - Just click "Render Cue"

## Technical Details:

### All Updated Files:

- ✅ `properties.py` - Changed storage location
- ✅ `ui.py` - Updated to use `context.scene.rendercue`
- ✅ `render.py` - Updated to use `context.scene.rendercue`
- ✅ `operators.py` - Updated all operators and poll methods
- ✅ `vse.py` - Updated VSE sync operator

### No Breaking Changes:

- All existing functionality works the same
- Just now it persists!

## Future Enhancement (Optional):

### Bidirectional VSE Sync:

Could add a **"Sync from VSE"** operator that:

- Reads strip order from VSE Channel 1
- Updates RenderCue queue to match
- Allows visual reordering in VSE
- Click sync to update render order

This would complete the VSE integration loop!
